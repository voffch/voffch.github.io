Some time ago, I got tired of our conference webpage, which was hosted on a website of our, well, *institution* [here](https://insma.urfu.ru/science/conf/ruten) (I won't even try to explain the relationship between the said *institution*, the uni and the department for fear of being *institutionalized* as a result). That website is a terminally outdated Joomla and stuff. So I spent a day ~~shitcoding~~ hardcoding `html+css` for a simple landing page, here (at the time of writing):

**[conferenceusu.github.io](https://conferenceusu.github.io/)**

Well, the design was kinda inspired by the page that I had made for fun as a project for [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Since the actual conference website lacks those funny parallax scrolling effects and inappropriate pictures from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/), here it is in its entirety:

**[mockference](/mockference.html)** (there's no "go back" button though)

That's probably a very sloppy design anyway, but, oh, my, those parallax pictures... I just **love** them!

## And now, a bit of history

which means, here goes my incoherent rant; you can stop reading right now and go do something productive.

Years ago, our glorious uni rejected our humble request to host the webpage of the conference on its 3rd-level domain (*.urfu.ru) using its Typo3 CMS. The reason they named was so stupid that even a man awarded Guinnes World Record for idiocy would find it hilarious. Namely,

> the conference is annual, and the webpage will be just sitting here doing nothing all the year round after the conference ends

...yeah, it's been, like, 30+ years and this here *annual* conference with its archive is still here, *duh*, and it's not like it's going anywhere anytime soon. Its info page is one of the most accessed pages of our whole, ahem, *institution*, for G*d's sake! What's even more funny is that there are (and were, at the moment of our request) even crappier conferences hosted under *.urfu.ru...

What were you smoking back then, you *ladies* from the UrFU's "*Center for Positioning and Brand Technologies*"? Yes, this is a literal translation of an actual department name, and yes, this name and the intended functions of this department don't make sense in Russian either. I guess, this whole situation is caused by perversely vague *corporate policies* enacted by crazy cat ladies.
